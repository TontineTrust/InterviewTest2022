## Actuarial Interview Question

Your task is to compute the probability of dying at any point in a month, for every month of a person's life from ages 60 through 100.

You may use the `qx` time series for British males for the years 2018-2020 in the spreadsheet `qxtimeseries.xlsx`.

You must devise a proof for the correctness of your model. Bonus points if it is a rigorous mathematical proof, but an informal but unambiguous paragraph could suffice as well.

You are free to choose your method to go about doing this, as long as any assumptions and/or decisions made are justified in a write-up.

You can choose how you want to present your solution. It could be tabular, graphical, or a combination of the two.
